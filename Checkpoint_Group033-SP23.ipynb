    "\n",
    "Pests are one of the main issues in the agricultural industry we have today. If left unchecked, they can damage plants, food supplies, and property. According to the research, using machine learning improves the accuracy of insect detection than the traditional insect identification method.\n",
    "In this project, we are aiming to classify and detect insect pests that have greatly affected agricultural products. Additionally, we want to measure the accuracy of different machine learning methods. The data are images which are already classified and labeled. Using this data, we will be processing the data then constructing a model to create a multi-class classifier and use mean squared error or cross validation to compare different models. Utilizing different evaluation metrics such as precision and recall and cross validation, we will determine the best hyperparameters and model. Our project will focus on model selection as well as algorithm selection to determine the best model that accurately predicts the class of the insect given an image. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Agriculture is a substantial aspect of the world economy making up 5.4% of the United States GDP in 2021. This percentage amounts to $1.264 trillion.<a name=\"USDA\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#USDA)The performance of the agricultural sector has wide ranging ramifications and implications in all parts of everyday life. \n",
    "\n",
    "Insects are a critical component of the agricultural ecosystem. From major pollinators such as bees and mosquitoes to pests such as aphids, some insects provide vital services to farmers while others could possibly be detrimental to the survival of a crop and subsequently the livelihood of surrounding settlements. Large quantities of pests such as grasshoppers, locusts, and caterpillars can result in widespread damage to crops and potentially lead to famine.Traditionally, identifying and managing insects and pests has relied on labor intensive and time consuming methods. Farmers and other agricultural experts would visually inspect plants and use insecticides based on general knowledge of common insects. However, these approaches are limited in accuracy and efficiency, leading to environmental risks. Using machine learning for insect recognition helps solve these problems, as they process large amounts of image data. Farmers can benefit from improved accuracy and efficiency in pest management decisions. Accurate pest identification enables farmers to respond more effectively to threats, reducing the risk of crop damage and financial losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies conducted on similar datasets, such as 9 and 24 insect classes of Wang and Xie datasets, enhanced, augmented and rescaled the images. Shape features, including area, perimeter, axis lengths, eccentricity, and compactness were then extracted from the insect images and stored in feature models. ANN, SVM, KNN, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and NB (Naive Bayes) algorithms were applied to classify the insects, and their performance was evaluated.<a name=\"Insect Classification\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#InsectClass) The CNN model had the highest classification accuracy of 91.5\\% and 90\\% for the Wang and Xie datasets. Another study by Xie et al. used a 19-layer CNN network which outperformed previous state-of-the-art models on the same task.<a name=\"National\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#National)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is significant to understand the optimal ways to identify insects. There are many ways to conduct insect classification, both traditional or through machine learning. However, machine learning provides an optimal solution that can be utilized to improve accuracy and efficiency of predictions. \n"

    "\n",
    "It is difficult to identify pests with traditional methods or machine learning methods that are not suitable for image processing.\n",
    "The multilayer perceptron (MLP) or Linear Discriminant Analysis or Convolutional Neural Network are models that will be focused on for this problem. MLP is a supervised learning method that is mainly used for pattern recognition. The Linear Discriminant Analysis is another method used for data classification. A convolutional neural network may perform the best for extracting data from our data. Our dataset consists of images that are correctly classified already. Our model aims to learn from this data set through supervised machine learning in order to correctly recognize patterns within the images and label them accordingly."

    "We will be utilizing the IP102 Dataset<a name=\"IP102\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#IP102). This dataset consists of 75,222 images and 102 classes of insects. It averages 737 samples/images per class. This data set already has a split of 6:1:3.\n",
    "The insects are of varying sizes and location within the image and therefore these placements might pose as critical variables for classifying an image . The labels are represented through one hot encoding in order to create labels that have a uniform effect on the measurement of the loss. Some special handlings that will be implemented is that the images will be scaled to a fixed input size in order to minimize the space used by each image. Time augmentation will be used where images will be altered, shifted ,flipped, and color shifts/adjustments. The critical variables will be extracted from the image during training.\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to establish a strong connection to the problem at hand. In this case, correctly identifying insects in farming scenarios is crucial for pest control, determining optimal cultivation practices, and minimizing crop damage. By accurately classifying insects, farmers can take targeted actions and make informed decisions to optimize crop yield and reduce economic losses. \n",
    "The correct classification of insects is crucial for effective farming of crops from an economic perspective. To achieve this, we will employ an image classifier, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is a multiclass classifier and by creating our own (explained below). By utilizing multiway classifiers, we take an input image and accurately classify it into predefined classes within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a multiclass classifier, we will leverage different models like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and a neural network with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), aka CNN. The Sklearn library provides convenient methods for building these models and creating a classifier. It offers various options for the number of layers and solvers, allowing us to experiment and optimize the performance of the classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to highlight the effectiveness of image classifiers in handling complex visual data. CNNs, in particular, excel at extracting features from images, enabling accurate classification, and combined with the use of LDA,  allows us to handle multiple classes and make predictions accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set that we are currently using contains a training, test, and validation set, allowing us to perform rigorous testing and evaluation. Cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold validation, will also be applied to assess the generalization capability of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish a benchmark for testing our solution, we can utilize models that have shown high performance on similar tasks. One such model is AlexNet, which achieved impressive results on the ImageNet dataset, a large-scale image classification benchmark. By comparing the performance of our model against AlexNet, we can assess its effectiveness and determine areas for improvement.\n"

The problem with this dataset is that due to the large sum of data and the high dimensionality of the inputs, the model is hard to make computationally efficient and iterations take a long time to run. \n",
    "Our preliminary base model is a Resnet34 which is a convolutional neural network that utilizes residual blocks to take in an input image of 34x34 and output a classification. All input images are resized into a 34x34 image in order to feed this into the NN. The data is also transformed in a variety of psuedo random ways. The transforms that are applied to the input data are; a random vertical flip, a random adjustment to the sharpness, a random horizontal flip and color jitter. These flip transformations are used to increase the datasets size during training and also reduce overfitting and introduce diversity allowing the model to better generalize. "
