    "\n",
    "Pests are one of the main issues in the agricultural industry we have today. If left unchecked, they can damage plants, food supplies, and property. According to the research, using machine learning improves the accuracy of insect detection than the traditional insect identification method.\n",
    "In this project, we are aiming to classify and detect insect pests that have greatly affected agricultural products. Additionally, we want to measure the accuracy of different machine learning methods. The data are images which are already classified and labeled. Using this data, we will be processing the data then constructing a model to create a multi-class classifier and use mean squared error or cross validation to compare different models. Utilizing different evaluation metrics such as precision and recall and cross validation, we will determine the best hyperparameters and model. Our project will focus on model selection as well as algorithm selection to determine the best model that accurately predicts the class of the insect given an image. \n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Agriculture is a substantial aspect of the world economy making up 5.4% of the United States GDP in 2021. This percentage amounts to $1.264 trillion.<a name=\"USDA\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#USDA)The performance of the agricultural sector has wide ranging ramifications and implications in all parts of everyday life. \n",
    "\n",
    "Insects are a critical component of the agricultural ecosystem. From major pollinators such as bees and mosquitoes to pests such as aphids, some insects provide vital services to farmers while others could possibly be detrimental to the survival of a crop and subsequently the livelihood of surrounding settlements. Large quantities of pests such as grasshoppers, locusts, and caterpillars can result in widespread damage to crops and potentially lead to famine.Traditionally, identifying and managing insects and pests has relied on labor intensive and time consuming methods. Farmers and other agricultural experts would visually inspect plants and use insecticides based on general knowledge of common insects. However, these approaches are limited in accuracy and efficiency, leading to environmental risks. Using machine learning for insect recognition helps solve these problems, as they process large amounts of image data. Farmers can benefit from improved accuracy and efficiency in pest management decisions. Accurate pest identification enables farmers to respond more effectively to threats, reducing the risk of crop damage and financial losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies conducted on similar datasets, such as 9 and 24 insect classes of Wang and Xie datasets, enhanced, augmented and rescaled the images. Shape features, including area, perimeter, axis lengths, eccentricity, and compactness were then extracted from the insect images and stored in feature models. ANN, SVM, KNN, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and NB (Naive Bayes) algorithms were applied to classify the insects, and their performance was evaluated.<a name=\"Insect Classification\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#InsectClass) The CNN model had the highest classification accuracy of 91.5\\% and 90\\% for the Wang and Xie datasets. Another study by Xie et al. used a 19-layer CNN network which outperformed previous state-of-the-art models on the same task.<a name=\"National\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#National)\n",

    "It is significant to understand the optimal ways to identify insects. There are many ways to conduct insect classification, both traditional or through machine learning. However, machine learning provides an optimal solution that can be utilized to improve accuracy and efficiency of predictions. \n"

    "\n",
    "It is difficult to identify pests with traditional methods or machine learning methods that are not suitable for image processing.\n",
    "The multilayer perceptron (MLP) or Linear Discriminant Analysis or Convolutional Neural Network are models that will be focused on for this problem. MLP is a supervised learning method that is mainly used for pattern recognition. The Linear Discriminant Analysis is another method used for data classification. A convolutional neural network may perform the best for extracting data from our data. Our dataset consists of images that are correctly classified already. Our model aims to learn from this data set through supervised machine learning in order to correctly recognize patterns within the images and label them accordingly."

    "The insects are of varying sizes and location within the image and therefore these placements might pose as critical variables for classifying an image . The labels are represented through one hot encoding in order to create labels that have a uniform effect on the measurement of the loss. Some special handlings that will be implemented is that the images will be scaled to a fixed input size in order to minimize the space used by each image. Time augmentation will be used where images will be altered, shifted ,flipped, and color shifts/adjustments. The critical variables will be extracted from the image during training."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is economically imperative that insects are classified correctly when farming a crop. Utilizing an image classifier such as a convolutional neural network, or multiclass classifier, an image can be taken in and accurately classified into the predetermined classes of the data set. Utilizing different models such as LDA and a neural network of MLP we can construct a multiclass classifier that can be applied to this data set. We will use the library Sklearn to build our model and create a classifier using different amounts of layers and solvers. The sklearn library contains methods of models that make this implementation simple. A benchmark model that can be used is AlexNet, an image classification model that scored highly on ImageNet.  \n",

The data is sourced primarily from the Internet, relying on top 2000 search engine results for the names of insects, which could result in some collection bias. Video clips containing the insects are also used, which are captured as images at 5 frames per second. \n",
    "The images in the dataset are of insects, and do not involve human subjects or locations. This eliminates issues with consent, personally identifiable information, protected group status, or stereotype perpetuation. The output given by the algorithm may have harmful implications if insects are incorrectly identified as pests, as the overuse of pesticides can impact the environment. "
